# Proficiency Demo Practice
## Practice Questions for PSU Proficiency Demos.

This repo is intended to help students practice for the PSU proficiency demos for CS163 / CS202.

There are files for each of the different structures that will be covered in the demos and each of these files.
There will be practice questions that give the description of the question, followed by the prototype.

# Usage
Each directory contains a makefile for the directory, with the following options:

``make``
    will compile questions.cpp, main.cpp, supplied.o

``make clean``
    will update questions.cpp with questions from questions.txt

``make run``
    will compile the appropriate files and then run the resulting a.out if there are no errors.
